/* You're tasked with performing graph analyses using a relational database 
system. You quickly recognize that recursion is needed to analyze arbitrary 
graphs using SQL queries. Fortunately, recursive SQL is available in some 
systems. In these exercises, you'll develop queries on a small graph with 
colored nodes and weighted edges. A SQL file to set up the schema and data 
for these exercises is "colored-graph.sql" here. This schema and data can be loaded 
as specified in the file into SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL, but currently only 
PostgreSQL supports recursion. See our quick guide for installing and using PostgreSQL.

Schema:
Node ( nID, color )
Edge ( n1, n2, weight )  // n1 and n2 identify nID's in table Node

As a guide to test the accuracy of your SQL queries, the correct query results over 
the provided data can be seen by pressing the button at the bottom of the page. 
You can return results in any order, but you may find it convenient to sort them in
order to compare your results against the correct ones.*/
